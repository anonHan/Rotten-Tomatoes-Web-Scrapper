# Rotten-Tomatoes-Web-Scrapper

We all data enthusiasts know the one of the famous saying that **Data is the new Oil**.
But there comes a big question in my mind everytime I come across with it that: 
 - How would you get this oil?
 - How would you mine it? 
 - Is there any special machinery available in the market to extract the data from the different websites?

Unfortunately not, there very less or no data extraction pipelines out there in the market. The one that are available will cost one him his arm and leg, and the major problem is that every website have different structure, so these tools can't extract data from all the websites. So, with all these things in my mind, I came with an idea to create a simple user freindly web scrapping tool for the world famous website [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/).

This tool can gather all the reviews given by the user to any movie on the website (as long as the website contains the reviews of the provided movie) and saves it in the csv format in the local system.

## Getting Started with it:
- Download all the files in your local system.
- Create a separate work space (recommended).
- Install all the required files from the requirement.txt using **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**.
- Inside the **RunApp.py** file change the URL of the movie as per your requirement.
- Execute the RunApp.py file.
- The reviews will be save along with their rating in a comma separated file in your system, by the name **RottenTomatoes.csv**.
